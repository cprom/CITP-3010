I prefer to use complex statements over nested statement.  I find that complex statements are easier to read and follow.
Nested statements can get very hard to follow depending on how deeply the statements are nested.  This in my opinion could
lead to more errors in the code.

Of course there are certain circumstances that nested statement are more useful then complex statements.
For instance when having to check multiple conditions in a specific order, or if you have to execute
different code based on the results of multiple conditions.
